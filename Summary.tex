Information technologies are a fundamental part of the major changes being made, from process automation to the creation of new information systems. The automobile industry is focused on creating vehicles that meet a better experience for the crew when moving from one place to another, creating vehicles with greater comfort and safety.
However, these industries are working with technology that is not accessible to the general public, plus there is no process to include accessible to vehicles less recent models technology.\\[\separacionCorta]

A methodology is presented to include accessible vehicles low-end technology, with the intention of increasing satisfaction crewman when traveling, implementing actuators can add safety and comfort to the vehicle and provide security to the same owner.\\[\separacionCorta]

The methodology proposed to implement in a vehicle GOLF GL 91  actuators for a better experience at a low cost compared to get a vehicle with these tools for improvement.\\[\separacionCorta]

The results are automating some parameters by creating a mobile application that manipulates certain actuators built into the vehicle via Bluetooth technology as a means of communication and concurrently monitors the emission of some gases of the vehicle.\\[\separacionCorta]

In conclusion it can be mentioned that the integration of technology into the vehicle GOLF has been satisfactory, because there is a manipulation of certain actuators via the mobile application developed, the implementation of continuous monitoring of emissions of certain gases helps verify the condition of the vehicle and notify an irregularity of environmental pollution.\\[\separacionCorta]
